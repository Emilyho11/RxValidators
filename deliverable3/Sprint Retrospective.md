# Challenges
- Finding time to work on this project (due to Midterms)
- Figuring out the best way to create the frontend
- Learning how React works
- Figuring out how to integrate the backend with the frontend 
- Finding the right APIs (that are free) to use to grab images and nearby locations/opportunities for the Green Resources map

# To Improve for the Next Sprint
- Ask any unclear processes earlier to ensure that we don't start un-needed tasks
- Ensure that members are able to complete their tasks on time or if stories need to be pushed to the next sprint
- Better communication among team members in regards to which tasks are assigned to whom and the status on how far along they are
- Decide beforehand the way to implement prescription logs so that others don't need to wait for implementation to pull data
- Those working on similar tasks, give frequent updates to each other so that code and implementation are consistent and not duplicated
- Push our code more often to GitHub so that team members can see each otherâ€™s progress
