# To Improve for the Next Sprint
- Ensure that members are able to complete their tasks on time or if stories need to be pushed to the next sprint
- Better communication among team members in regards to which tasks are assigned to whom and the status on how far along they are
- Decide beforehand the way to implement prescription logs so that others don't need to wait for implementation to pull data
- Those working on similar tasks, give frequent updates to each other so that code and implementation are consistent
